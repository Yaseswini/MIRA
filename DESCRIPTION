Title: Methylation-Based Inference of Regulatory Activity
Description: MIRA measures the degree of "dip" in methylation
    level surrounding a regulatory site of interest, such as a
    transcription factor binding site, for instances of that
    type of site across the genome which can then be used to 
    infer regulatory activity.
